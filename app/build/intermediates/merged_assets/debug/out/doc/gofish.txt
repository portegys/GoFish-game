Goal

To collect the most sets of four.

Gameplay

On your turn, ask other player for a specific card rank.
You mustalready hold at least one card of the requested rank.

If the other player has any cards of the requested rank,
he must give all ofhis cards of that rank to you.

If you get one or more cards from the other player, you get
another turn.

If the other player has no relevant cards, you must "Go fish"
by drawing the top card from the draw pile.

If you happen to draw a card of the rank asked for, you get
another turn. However, if you draw a card that's not the rank
you asked for, it becomes the other player's turn. You keep the
drawn card, whatever rank it is.

When a player collects a set of four cards of the same rank,
his score increases by one.

Winning

Go Fish continues until either player has no cards left in their
hand or the draw pile runs out. The winner is the player who then
has the most sets of four.
